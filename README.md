# FizzBuzz Solution with Rule-Based Mapping
This FizzBuzz implementation showcases a creative and efficient approach to solving the classic FizzBuzz problem using C++ and the power of map data structures.

# Benefits of This Solution
Scalability: Unlike traditional FizzBuzz implementations that often involve multiple nested conditional statements, this solution scales efficiently. It can handle arbitrary rule sets without adding complexity to the code, making it suitable for more complex scenarios beyond the standard FizzBuzz problem.
